# **Executive Summary**
*Netflix is a global streaming powerhouse creating high-quality, binge-worthy content that captivates audiences worldwide. As part of the Public Relations team, I analyze Top 10 viewership data to uncover trending hits, celebrate Netflix's biggest successes, and tell stories about its global impact.*

# **Data Acquisition**
In order to acquire the latest Netflix Top 10 data, we ran the following code to get the Global Top 10 and Country-wide Top 10 data sets.
```{r}
#| echo: true
#| message: false
#| warning: false
#| codefold: true
if(!dir.exists(file.path("data", "mp01"))){
    dir.create(file.path("data", "mp01"), showWarnings=FALSE, recursive=TRUE)
}

GLOBAL_TOP_10_FILENAME <- file.path("data", "mp01", "global_top10_alltime.csv")

if(!file.exists(GLOBAL_TOP_10_FILENAME)){
    download.file("https://www.netflix.com/tudum/top10/data/all-weeks-global.tsv", 
                  destfile=GLOBAL_TOP_10_FILENAME)
}

COUNTRY_TOP_10_FILENAME <- file.path("data", "mp01", "country_top10_alltime.csv")

if(!file.exists(COUNTRY_TOP_10_FILENAME)){
    download.file("https://www.netflix.com/tudum/top10/data/all-weeks-countries.tsv", 
                  destfile=COUNTRY_TOP_10_FILENAME)
}
```

# **Data Import and Preparation**
After acquiring the data, we need to clean it up a bit so it has a suitable format. To do so, we downloaded the following code using the *str()* and *glimpse()* functions for both global and country data sets. We also ensured that the *N/A* values are read as *NA* values using the following codes:
```{r}
#| echo: true
#| message: false
#| warning: false
#| codefold: true
if(!require("tidyverse")) install.packages("tidyverse")
library(readr)
library(dplyr)

GLOBAL_TOP_10 <- read_tsv(GLOBAL_TOP_10_FILENAME)
```

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| message: false
#| warning: false
#| codefold: true
# changing "N/A" strings into NA values
GLOBAL_TOP_10 <- GLOBAL_TOP_10 |>
    mutate(season_title = if_else(season_title == "N/A", NA, season_title))

# changing "N/A" strings to NA values
COUNTRY_TOP_10 <- read_tsv(COUNTRY_TOP_10_FILENAME, na = c("N/A"))
```

# **Initial Data Exploration**
After gathering the data, we formatted it in order to create summarized data sets and descriptive statistics. Out of the four data sets generated, the last one was correctly formatted using the following codes below:
```{r}
#| echo: true
#| message: false
#| warning: false
#| codefold: true


library(DT)

  head(n=20) |>

    df
}

    format_titles() |>
    head(n=20) |>
    datatable(options=list(searching=FALSE, info=FALSE)) |>
    formatRound(c('Weekly Hours Viewed', 'Weekly Views'))
```

```{r}

```

Bollywood is taking over Netflix's algorithm and we're not complaining anytime soon. 

The Hindi film *RRR*, which was released in 2022, garnered so much traction on Netflix that it has approximately **`r rrr_hours`** total hour views currently and spent **`r rrr_weeks` weeks** on the Global Top 10 List. On top of those incredible numbers, they also managed to win an Oscar for Best Original Song for their "Naatu Naatu". These achievements were monumental for India, as both Netflix and the Academy Awards are closely followed, marking a proud moment for Indian audiences on the global stage.

The top 10 Hindi films combined from the Global Top 10 has **`r total_hindi_hours`** viewership hours which shows just how much India is a major market for Netflix. With these numbers increasing, global recognition of Bollywood Film and TV is not far out of reach. Bollywood tell their stories through the art of singing and dancing, something that Hollywood has been slowly trying to integrate.
